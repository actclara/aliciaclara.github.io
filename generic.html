								<h2>Background Information</h2>
								<p>Cyclistic is a fictional bike-sharing company based in Chicago. The marketing director believes the 
									company's future depends on maximizing number of annual memberships. Additionally, financial analysts at the company 
									have concluded that annual membership riders are much more profitable than casual riders. 
								</p>
								<p>Cyclistic has three types of pricing plans:<p></p> 
									1. single-ride passes <p></p> <p></p>
									2. full-day passes <p></p>
									3. annual memberships
								</p> Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are considered as casual riders and customers who purchased 
								annual memberships are called annual membership riders. <p></p>
								<h2>Objective</h2>
								<p>Understand differences between casual riders and annual membership riders, 
									why casual riders 
									would buy a membership, and how digital media can affect marketing tactics to influence casual riders to become annual membership riders.
								</p>
								<h2>About the Data </h2>
								<p>Used Cyclistic historical data to analyze and identify trends. The datasets have a different name 
									because Cyclistic is a fictional company. The dataset has been made available publicly by Motivate International Inc. under license agreement. 
									To protect data privacy, customer's personal information is undisclosed. At the making of this project, datasets considered are from 
									July 2020 to June 2021 being the recent datasets available.
